# Advent of Code 2022


## Input Files

You can place input files in the `data/` directory.

The text file for a day can be named anything so long as it contains the day number
somewhere in the file name surrounded by non-digit characters.


## Wishlist

Ways I would like to improve on the 2022 AoC framework.

* Read from input from files
* Add a benchmarking mode (give the JVM JIT time to warm up)
